// Reader is used for prompt/response communication protocols where a prompt
// is sent, and some time later a response is received. Typically, the target takes
// some amount to formulate the response, and then streams it out. There are two delays:
// an overall timeout, and the time interval between two data packets (inter frame delay).
// This delay is measured from the last received byte to the first next received byte.
// The thought is that once you received the 1st byte, all the data should stream out
// continuously and a short timeout can be used to determine the end of the packet.
